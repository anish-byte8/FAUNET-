        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="men"><p class="ha">1. What is an endangered species?<br><br>

An endangered species is a plant or animal that is at risk of becoming extinct because its population is very small or decreasing rapidly.</p> <br>

<p class="ha">2. What causes species to become endangered?<br><br>

The main causes include habitat loss, climate change, pollution, hunting, illegal trade, and introduction of invasive species.</p> <br>

<p class="ha">3. How does habitat destruction affect animals?<br><br>

When forests, oceans, or wetlands are destroyed, animals lose their homes, food sources, and breeding areas, making survival difficult. </p><br>

<p class="ha">4. What is extinction?<br><br>

Extinction occurs when the last member of a species dies, meaning the species no longer exists on Earth.</p> <br>

<p class="ha">5. What is the difference between “endangered” and “threatened”?<br><br>

Endangered species are at high risk of extinction soon. 

Threatened species are likely to become endangered in the near future.</p> <br>

<p class="ha">6. Which animals are currently endangered?<br><br>

Many species are endangered, including tigers, orangutans, pandas, elephants, sea turtles, rhinos, and many types of birds and amphibians.</p> <br><br><br>

<p class="ha">7. How does climate change affect wildlife?<br><br>

Rising temperatures, melting ice, and changing weather patterns disrupt natural habitats, food availability, and migration. </p><br><br><br>

<p class="ha">8. What is poaching?<br><br>

Poaching is the illegal killing, capturing, or trading of wildlife for products like ivory, fur, and exotic pets.</p> <br><br><br>

<p class="ha">9. Why are some species more at risk than others?<br><br>

Some animals reproduce slowly, have limited habitats, or require specific food sources, making them more sensitive to environmental changes. </p><br><br><br>

<p class="ha">10. What can students do to help endangered species?<br><br>
 
Students can recycle, reduce plastic use, avoid products made from wildlife, support conservation programs, and spread awareness. </p><br><br><br>

<p class="ha">11. What is a protected area?<br><br>

A protected area is a place like a national park or wildlife reserve where land and animals are kept safe from activities that could harm them. </p><br><br><br>

<p class="ha">12. What is biodiversity and why is it important?<br><br>

Biodiversity means the variety of life on Earth—plants, animals, and microorganisms. High biodiversity keeps ecosystems healthy and balanced.</p> <br><br><br>

<p class="ha">13. How do invasive species harm native wildlife?<br><br>

Invasive species compete with native animals for food and space, spread disease, or become predators, often harming local ecosystems. </p><br><br><br>

<p class="ha">14. What organizations work to protect endangered species?<br><br>

Groups like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), National Wildlife Federation, and many local conservation groups help protect wildlife. </p><br><br><br>

<p class="ha">15. What is the IUCN Red List?<br><br>

The IUCN Red List is a global database that ranks species by their risk of extinction, such as Least Concern, Vulnerable, Endangered, and Critically Endangered.</p>
